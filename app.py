#find a way to get a input of a picture
#read the information of the picture
# find the main features of the picture (maybe start with face first)
    #use an ai to recognize the main features
#convert the ai to meaningful results ( convert it to graph equations)
    #what kind of graphs?
#find a way to put the graph outputs in desmos automatically
